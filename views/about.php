				<h2>Business Model</h2>
				<p>The PetCloud website and apps software utilises the sharing economy and is a hybrid business model with both SAAS and Marketplace models.   It's the easiest way for animal lovers who want to monetise their backyard, car, and time to busy Pet Owners searching for Pet Care Professional services. Partner with us</p>
				<h2>Our Board</h2>
				<p>PetCloud has a Board of Directors who are responsible for the overall governance, management and strategic direction of the organisation.</p>
				<h2>Our Beginning</h2>
				<p>In 2007 Founder Deb saw an opportunity in at-home local pet care when she experienced a lack of availability when trying to book a pet stay with kennels and found that over peak periods, facilities around the city were quite booked out.</p>
				<p>Other factors were;</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Family members weren't pet lovers</li>
					<li>The kennel refused a tour of their facility saying it ‘upsets the other dogs’ (red flag)</li>
					<li>Employers required her to be away interstate (often at short notice)</li>
					<li>Her dog picked up kennel cough and wasshaken up after boarding at a kennel</li>
					<li>It was a very impersonal experience– over the phone they didn’t know her dog’s name, or which one her dog was.</li>
					<li>It was difficult to negotiate a change in pick up times if her plane was late to pick up pets as the kennel had strict closing times.</li>
					<li>When she did try a pet sitter, she had to wait for the paperwork to arrive in the post and then drive across town to meet a person she knew nothing about, didn’t know what they looked like, or what qualifications they had, and felt unsure of what questions to ask.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All of this made her think: “Surely I’m not the only one, this has got to be online!” And after asking many strangers in dog parks, she confirmed they had all experienced similar challenges.</p>
				<p>And so, PetCloud was born.</p>
				<h2>PetCloud has won Awards</h2>
				<p>PetCloud is also a Finalist for the Lord Mayor's High-Growth Business Start-Up, a finalist for the Lord Mayor's ISPT award for Digital Strategy and Business News Australia’s 40 Under 40: Top Young Entrepreneurs.</p>
